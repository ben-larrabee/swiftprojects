In fact, restaurants report a percentage (around 12%) of the gross sales for food and beverage to the IRS for their staff.  If you get awful service, talk to the manager. The manager cannot correct the situation if he doesn't know about it. Skipping the tip will not accomplish anything, and the next poor customer who gets that server will get the same service you did.  I recommend tipping 10-15% on the alcohol and 15-20% on the food.")
